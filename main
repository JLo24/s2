	<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
	<p>Name: Janica</p>
	<p>Course: IT</p>
	<p>Hobby: Playing Genshin Impact</p>
	<p>My motivation in choosing this course are my siblings. I have 2 siblings that graduated in IT and CS and it motivates me to also take this course. Also, my sister runs an IT company and hopefully to work in her company after I graduate.</p>
	<p>As an IT student, I experienced a lot of challenges because during my 1st year I never really know aboout logic. My logic is not as good as my other classmates and it really made me down at first. Now, I am trying to learn more in youtube and in some sites that helps me in developing a system.</p>
